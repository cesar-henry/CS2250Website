                        I am typically not a fan of musicals or anything related to that genre
                        because I think that a lot of them are more or less the same. However, I 
                        think this one is an exception. What makes this film memorable for many is 
                        its music; this film features a plethora of songs that are unique in their
                        own ways. In terms of the romance in this story, the film does an excellent
                        job portraying the love and chemistry between Mia and Sebastian. Personally,
                        I think the crown jewel of this movie would be its ending as it is what makes 
                        this film stand out from the other musicals. Endings to stories are difficult 
                        to pull off; not everyone will be happy how it ends. Although the ending
                        itself is not one that is particularly happy, it is one that should satisfy
                        all viewers, no matter how they interpret it.

                        Breaking Bad is one of the greatest shows on television, and I do not
                        exaggerate when I say that. The show does an excellent job of portraying 
                        Walter White's journey from a boring high school chemistry teacher to a 
                        fearsome drug kingpin. The writing in this show conveys a plethora of
                        themes from power to the importance of family. I cannot even count the 
                        amount of memorable lines and scenes in this show since there are so many.
                        The characters featured in this show are well-written as well, each having 
                        their own unique place and identity in the show. One character that 
                        particularly stands out to me the most is the eccentric lawyer Saul Goodman.
                        Overall, the show is an absolute must watch.
