                    Chess is a game that I enjoy playing as it involves a lot of thinking<br>
                    and strategy. The rules are very simple, but the game itself has much <br>
                    depth.

                <p class="description">
                    osu! is a popular rhythm game that I enjoy playing in my free time.<br>
                    There are four different game modes in osu but the only one that I<br>
                    play regularly is standard osu in which the player clicks and drags circles<br>
                    to the beat of the song.

                <p class="description">
                    Valorant is a team-based free-to-play tactical first-person-shooter game<br>
                    developed by Riot Games. This is a game that I genuinely do not enjoy playing.<br>
                    I have never played a game that has made me more upset, angry, and disappointed <br>
                    at myself and others than any other game I have played. I will never willingly <br>
                    play this game by myself. However, for the sake of having friends, I only play <br>
                    this game whenever another friend asks me to play.
